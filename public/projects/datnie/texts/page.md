## Project Overview

Datnie is a mixed reality dating app designed to reduce conversation fatigue.  
Through hands-first interaction, users explore matches, express interest, and communicate without relying on text-heavy input.  
As conversations evolve, repeated behaviors are reflected back through the interface, turning familiar responses into lighter interactions.

*Hang out and meet someone who matches you daily.*

## Design Challenge

Dating apps often rely on repetitive, text-heavy interactions that interrupt emotional flow.  
Users spend more time replying than connecting, leading to passive scrolling and interaction fatigue.

---

## Key Insight

When interaction becomes vocal, physical, and spatial, communication feels lighter and more natural.  
Gestures can replace typing, and visual feedback can reduce cognitive load — allowing users to focus on presence rather than replies.

---

## Solution

Datnie explores a gesture- and voice-driven mixed reality experience,  
where interaction is shaped through motion, timing, and visual response rather than traditional menus.

The system concept emphasizes reducing repetition while preserving personal expression through adaptive interface behavior.

## User Journey

*(Gesture-based interaction explored through visual and animation-driven prototypes)*

### 1. Swipe

Swipe to skip and move to the next match.  
A continuous gesture used as a navigational metaphor to maintain flow and reduce decision pressure.

---

### 2. Tap → Swipe → Tap

Tap to enter, swipe to navigate within profile layers, tap again to explore deeper content.  
A gesture sequence designed to replace hierarchical UI with spatial progression.

---

### 3. Double Tap — Like

Double-tap to like the current match.  
A deliberate gesture chosen to convey intent and emotional emphasis.

---

### 4. Hold — Voice to Text

Hold to activate voice input and send a message.  
A time-based gesture that supports conversational continuity and presence.

---

### 5. Repeated Answer Concept

As conversations continue, frequently used responses are surfaced and reused through interface prompts.  
A conceptual exploration of how behavior patterns can reduce repetitive input.

## Core Contributions

- Designed and modeled characters in **Blender**, and implemented replaceable **groom-based fur visuals** in **Unreal Engine** to enhance expressive presence  

- Created animation-driven interaction feedback, focusing on how characters and UI visually respond to user actions  

- Designed a gesture-oriented UI structure (tap, swipe, double-tap, hold) as an **interaction vocabulary** rather than a technical system  

- Rapidly prototyped visual, animation, and UI concepts directly in engine to explore interaction flow and experiential quality

## My Approach

I focus on visualizing interaction ideas through animation and spatial UI —  
using motion, timing, and feedback to explore how interfaces feel rather than how they are technically implemented.

By prototyping directly in the engine, I translate interaction concepts into tangible, experiential prototypes.
