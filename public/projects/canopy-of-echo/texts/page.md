1. Overview

Canopy of Echo is a real-scale kinetic installation that turns heritage memory into motion, rhythm, and light.
Designed for the Great Bao’en Temple under the competition theme “One Wall, One Tower, One River,” the work connects Nanjing’s artefacts and citizens through an interactive “river of stories.”

2. Context

Historic narratives often feel distant because they’re locked inside sites, objects, and text.

Design challenge:
How can a heritage installation make history spatial, observable, and emotionally engaging—so visitors don’t just read stories, but encounter them?

3. Deliverables

Our team delivered a complete pipeline from concept to physical + digital prototyping:

Full-scale physical installation

Miniature model

Unreal Engine interaction prototype

VR prototype

5. User Journey
5.1 Connection with the River — Flow of Memory

The installation moves in a continuous sine-wave rhythm, mirroring the river and symbolizing the flow of collective memory.

5.2 Connection with the Wall — Reconstructing What Once Stood

Facing the ancient city wall, the roofline references the lost tower. Visitors can visually “restore” the historic architecture through perspective.

5.3 Connection with the Tower — Approaching Stories

When visitors step close to a unit, the winch pauses so they can observe and absorb the embedded story.

5.4 Connection with the Audience — Participatory Heritage

Visitors are encouraged to explore the city, rediscover relics, and upload personal stories—expanding the installation with living memory over time.

6. Core Contributions
6.1 Storytelling & Unit Design

In collaboration with Jingru, I distilled 18 historical and contemporary stories into narrative modules embedded in each kinetic unit. Examples:

The Returning Relics
A family donated 30+ treasured artefacts: “These are our roots — they cannot be sold.” A quiet act of public heritage protection.

History Beneath Our Feet
A brick used to prop up an elderly woman’s stool was found to be a 600-year-old Ming city wall brick—history hidden in daily life.

From Shield to Foundation
A former defensive brick now supports Nanjing University’s architecture—shifting from protecting the city to supporting generations.

Together, these stories form a flowing narrative landscape linking wall, tower, river, and citizens into one evolving memory.

6.2 Unreal Interactive Prototype — Interactive Winch System

I built a real-time pipeline connecting:

Unreal Engine ↔ TouchDesigner ↔ OSC

Two motion states:

Sinewave Mode — smooth continuous motion

Freeze Mode — pauses when visitors approach




Using MediaPipe, cameras detect visitor positions.
When someone enters a zone, the corresponding unit freezes, then resumes after they leave—creating a clear reading-and-discovery rhythm.

6.3 Video Production

I wrote the script, built animation beats, set up scenes and lighting, and rendered the narrative video to communicate the concept, interaction logic, and heritage value.

7. Outcome
